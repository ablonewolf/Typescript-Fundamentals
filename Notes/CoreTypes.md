# Typescript Core Types

Several core types are there in typescript. They are:

- number: includes integers and floats
- string: all text values
- boolean: true, false, no truthy or falsy values unlike javascript

Key Difference: in Javascript, types are set dynamically during runtime; whereas in Typescript, types are set statically during development.
